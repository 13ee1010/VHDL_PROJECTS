# First-In-First-Out


First-in-first-out (FIFO) buffers act as storage between two subsystems. One subsystem stores data into the buffer, and the
other sybsystem retrieves the data and removes it from the buffer. The data is retrieved in the same order it is stored, and
hence the name.

The implementation and simulation of the first-in-first out buffer is done in Xilinx Vivado 2020.1.
